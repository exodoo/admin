    "description": "Meet Wolf 940 b, a fascinating brown dwarf companion orbiting a distant star! This celestial body is about 26 times more massive than Jupiter, making it a true giant in our cosmic neighborhood. Located an incredible 400 AU from its host star (that's 400 times the distance between Earth and our Sun!), Wolf 940 b takes us on a journey to the outer reaches of its solar system. Despite its enormous size, it's only slightly smaller than Jupiter in radius, hinting at its dense, compact nature. Discovered in 2009 through the exciting method of direct imaging, Wolf 940 b continues to captivate astronomers with its unique characteristics and the mysteries it holds about brown dwarf formation and evolution.",

This massive gas giant, with a mass about 13 times that of Jupiter, was discovered in 2013 through direct imaging. It orbits its host star at an impressive distance of about 100 astronomical units, taking over 500 years to complete one orbit. With a scorching temperature of around 1850 Kelvin, this young planet (only about 47 million years old) provides valuable insights into planetary formation and evolution.",
